# Introduction

## What's machine learning

* Experience: previous information obtained through interaction with the environment
* Theoretical learning guarantees for an algorithm depend on the complexity of the concept classes considered and the size of the training sample.
* Data-driven: statistics, probability, and optimization

## What kind of porblems can be tackled using machine learning

* Text or document classification
* Natural language processing (NLP)
* Speech processing applications
* Computer vision applications
* Computational biology applications
* ...

## Some standard learning tasks

* Classification
* Regression
* Ranking
* Clustering
* Dimentionality reduction or manifold learning

## Learning stages

* Examples
* Features: prior knowledge
* Labels
* Hyperparameters
* Training sample
* Validation sample
* Test sample
* Loss function: $L : \mathcal{Y \times Y'} \rightarrow \mathbb{R_+}$
* Hypothesis set

## Learning scenarios

* Supervised learning: classification, regression, ranking
* Unsupervised learning: clustering, dimentionality reduction
* Semi-supervised learning
* Transductive inference
* On-line learning: no distributional assuption
* Reinforcement learning: exploration v.s. exploitation
* Active learning

## Generalization

Complex hypothesis set leads to less error on thetraining sample
