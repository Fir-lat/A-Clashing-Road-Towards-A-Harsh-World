# The PAC Learning Framework

The PAC framwork helps define the class of learnable concepts in terms of the number of sample points needed to achieve an approximate solution, _sample complexity_,  and the time and space complexity of the learning algorithm, which depends on the cost of the computational representation of the concepts.
